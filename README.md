# COGS-298 Project: Understanding Reinforcement Learning Through OpenAI Gym and Pong
## Background
This project is an attempt at both gaining a better understanding of the concepts behind reinforcement learning (RL) and imparting such knowledge onto others, by taking a closer look at Andrej Karpathy's RL [tutorial](#sources). Karpathy's work provides an excellent example of implementing and explaining complex features of RL algorithms like policy gradients, a method of improving the policy, an arbitrary rule used to determine what the agent should do based on the current state of the environment [(Sutton and Barto, 2018)](#sources). Policy gradients will be explained in further detail later. His post however, doesn't detail much of the general information about RL needed to fully understand what is happening. Explicitly explaining the components of RL should make the process of developing algorithms easier by providing a basis of considerations that must be implemented. Teaching an agent to play Pong is a deceivingly challenging task that will be examined closer.

## Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a field of machine learning focused on agent-environment interaction. In the context of RL, the agent is the decision maker, it receives observations about the current state of the environment and takes an action based on that information. The agent then receives  The environment includes whatever the agent has no control over.
