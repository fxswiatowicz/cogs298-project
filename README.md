# COGS-298 Project: Learning Reinforcement Learning Through OpenAI Gym and Keras
## Background
This project is an attempt at better understanding the concepts behind reinforcement learning (RL) by implementing Andrej Karpathy's [tutorial](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) with Keras, a neural network API. By abstracting a low-level, hand-coded algorithm into a high-level program with activation functions, optimization functions, etc., 'tucked' away as Keras model parameters, it is necessary to learn the underlying structure of the low-level implementation, thus gaining insight about neural network structure along with RL techniques.
### What is reinforcement learning?
